# FAQs

## A. Usage
```
Q1. How to paste Japanese tags to the console window?
    - Click the top-left icon -> select Edit -> Paste (Cannot use Ctrl-V), if
      it show up as question mark -> Change the Language for non-Unicode
      program to Japanese (google it).
    - or use online url encoder (http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder/)
      and paste the encoded tag back to the console.
    - or paste it to tags.txt and select download by tags list. Separate each
      tags with space, and separate with new line for new query.

Q2. My password doesn't show up in the console!
    - This is normal. The program still reads it.
    - or you can put in the config.ini if not sure.

Q3. I cannot login to Pixiv!
    - Check your password.
    - Try to login to the Pixiv Website.
    - Try to use the config.ini on the [Authentication] section.
    - Check your date and time setting (e.g.: https://www.timeanddate.com/)
    - Disable Daylight Saving Time and try again.
    - Copy your session values from browser:
      1. Open Firefox.
      2. Go to Pixiv website and login, remember to enable [Remember Me]
          check box.
      3. Right click the page and select View Page Info.
      4. Click the Security tab.
      5. Click the View Cookies button.
      6. Look for Cookie named = PHPSESSID.
      7. Copy the content value.
      8. Open config.ini, go to [Authentication] section, paste the value
          to cookie, set keepsignedin = 1.

Q4. PixivUtil working from local terminal on Linux box but not working when I
    used SSH with PuTTY!
    - export LANG=en_US.UTF-8. PuTTY does not set locales right, when they are
      not set, python does not know what to write (Thanks to nho!)
    - ... and export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8, so it can create DB and populate
      it properly (Thanks to Mailia!)

Q5. How to delete member id from Database?
    - Open the application and choose Manage Database (d) then select delete
      Member by Member Id.
    - Open the database (db.sqlite) directly using sqlite browser and use sql
      command to delete it.
    - If you are downloading using Download from List.txt (3), you can create
      ignore_list.txt to skip the member id.

Q6. The app doesn't download all the images! (I want to download SFW images too).
    - Pixiv only allow to search up to 1000 pages if you don't have Pixiv
      Premium.
    - Check your pixiv website settings (refer to https://goo.gl/gQi09v),
      then delete the cookie value in config.ini and retry.
    - Check the value of r18mode in config.ini. Setting it to True will only
      download R-18 images.

Q7. The apps show square/question mark texts in the console output!
    - This is because your Windows is not set to Japanese for the Regional Settings
      in control panel.
    - Since 20161114+ version, you need to set the console font properties to
      use font with unicode support (e.g. Arial Unicode, MS Gothic).

Q8. Where to get FFmpeg software? How to enable `createwebm`?
    - Download the stable version of FFmpeg from https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html.
    - For Windows:
      - Extract the archive to a folder.
      - Open the extracted folder and open to the `/bin` folder.
      - Copy the application `ffmpeg.exe` to your PixivUtil2 folder.
    - For Linux:
      - Install the package using your favorite package manager.

Q9. The downloaded images are corrupted, how to redownload it again?
    - You can delete the download history in databases by manually delete the image id
      from databases (enter d, followed by 10).
    - Or, you can set alwaysCheckFileSize = True and verifyimage = True in config.ini
      and retry the download.
      
Q10. I got this error またはメールアドレス、パスワードが正しいかチェックしてください。
    - Use your email address for the username, or check your password in config.ini

```
## C.Log Messages
```
Q1: HTTPError: HTTP Error 404: Not Found
    - This is because the file doesn't exist in the pixiv server, usually
       because there is no big images version for the manga mode (currently the
       apps will try to download the big version first then try the normal size
       if failed, this is only for the manga mode and it is normal).

Q2: Error at process_image(): (<type 'exceptions.WindowsError'>, WindowsError
    (32, 'Prosessi ei voi kayttaa tiedostoa, koska se on toisen prosessin
    kaytossa')
    - The file is being used by another process (google translate). Either you
      ran multiple instace of Pixiv downloader from the same folder, or there
      are other processes locking the file/db.sqllite (usually from antivirus
      or some sync/backup application).

Q3: Error at process_image(): (<type 'exceptions.AttributeError'>,
    AttributeError ("'NoneType' object has no attribute 'find'",)
    - Usually this is because of failed login (cookie not valid). Try to change
      your password to simple one for testing, or copy the cookie from browser:
      1. Open Firefox/Chrome.
      2. Login to your Pixiv.
      3. On Pixiv page, press F12 and choose the Storage tab (Firefox), or
         Right click on the leftmost address bar/the (i) icon (Chrome)
      5. Click the View Cookies button.
      6. Look for Cookie named = PHPSESSID.
      7. Copy the content value.
      8. Open config.ini, go to [Authentication] section, paste the value to
         cookie.
    - Or because Pixiv has changed the layout code, so the Pixiv
      downloader cannot parse the page correctly. Please tell me by posting a
      comment if this happens and include the details, such as the member/image
      id, dump html, and log file (check on the application folder).

Q4: URLError: <urlopen error [Errno 11004] getaddrinfo failed>
    - This is because the Pixiv downloader cannot resolve the address to
      download the images, please try to restart the network connection or do
      ipconfig /flushdns to refresh the dns cache (windows).

Q5: Error at download_image(): (<class 'socket.timeout'>, timeout('timed out',)
    - This is because the Pixiv downloader didn't receive any reply for
      specified time in config.ini from Pixiv. Please retry the download again
      later.

Q6: httperror_seek_wrapper: HTTP Error 403: request disallowed by robots.txt
    - Set userobots = False in config.ini
```

  ...
#comment - lines starting with # will be ignored
```

    \directory will save the folder in the root of your PixivUtil-drive
  - C:\directory will save the folder in drive C: (change to any other
    drive as you wish)
  - .\directory will save the folder in same directory as PixivUtil2.exe
  - directory-path can end with \ or not

- Examples for list:
```
### START EXAMPLE LIST####
# this is a comment line, lines starting with # will be ignored
# here is the first member:
123456
# you can see, the line has only the member id
# usually I use it the following way:
#
# username (so I can recognize it ;) )
123456
#
# next 2 lines contain a special folder for this member
123456 .\test
123456 ".\test"
# now all images from member no. 123456 will be safed in directory "test" in the
# same directory as PixivUtil2
# as you can see you can use it with "" or without ;)
#
# next will be stored at the same partition as PixivUtil, but the directory is
# located in root-part of it
123456 \test
123456 "\test"
# this will lead to "C:\test" when pixivUtil is located on "C:\"
#
# next line uses complete path to store the files
123456 F:\new Folder\test
123456 "F:\new Folder\test"
# this will set the folder everywhere on your partitions
#
123456 %root%\special folder
123456 "%root%\special folder"
# this will set the download location to "special folder" in your rootDirectory
# given in config
http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=123456
http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?id=123456
# also support url format.
### END EXAMPLE LIST####
```

# tags.txt Format
- This file will be used as source for Download from tags list (7)
- Separate tags with space, ensure to set Use Wildcard to 'y'.
- Each line will be treated as one search.
- Save the files with UTF-8 encoding.

# suppress_tags.txt Format
- This file is used for suppressing the tags from being used in %tags%.
- If matches, the tags will be removed from filename.
- Each line is one tag only.
- Save the files with UTF-8 encoding


# blacklist_tags.txt Format
- This file is used for tag blacklist checking for downloading image.
- If matches, the image will be skipped.
- Each line is one tag only.
- Save the files with UTF-8 encoding

# blacklist_members.txt Format
- similar to list.txt, but without custom folder.

# HTML Format
- A simple default format will be used when no 'template.html' is provided.
- Urls originally in the post will be overwritten with local paths.
- Currently available syntaxes are:
```
-> %coverImage%
   A 'div' tag with its 'class' set to 'cover', and a child 'img' tag with 
   the url to the cover image as its 'src' attribute.
-> %coverImageUrl%
   Simply the url to the cover image in clear text.
-> %artistName%
   Same as %artist% in 'Filename Format Syntax' in clear text.
-> %imageTitle%"
   Title of the post in clear text.
-> "%worksDate%"
   Published date of the post in clear text.
-> %body_text(article)%
   This works for article type posts only.
   A 'div' tag with its 'class' set to 'article', and the post's content,
   which is already formatted HTML if the post is article, as its inner text.
-> %images(non-article)%
   This works for none-article type posts only.
   A 'div' tag with its 'class' set to 'non-article images', and 'a' tags
   of all files in the post as its children tokens.
   For each 'a' tag, its 'href' would be url to the file, and the inner text
   would be an 'img' tag with its 'src' set to the url to the file if the
   file's extension is 'jpg', 'jpeg', 'png' or 'bmp'. Otherwise the inner text
   would simply be the url to the file.
-> %text(non-article)%
   This works for none-article type posts only.
   A 'div' tag with its 'class' set to 'non-article text' and all paragraphs
   of text put in 'p' tags as its children tokens.
```
- If there is a 'div' tag with 'main' in its 'class' in the template, 'article' or 
  'non-article' would be appended to its 'class' depending on the type of the post.

# Bad chars
- Originally for removing single bad chars for use between different OSs.
- Now also supports strings and regular expressions.
- The value set in option `customBadChars` would be parsed from left to right.
- Currently available syntaxes are:
```
-> %replace<default>(your_default_replace_with)%
   Use this syntax to define default value to replace with.
   If this syntax gets used multiple times in the option value, the first value would be used.
   If this value is not set, "_" would be used.
-> %pattern<you_group_name>(your_pattern)%
-> %replace<you_group_name>(your_replace_with)%
   Use these two syntaxes to set groups of rules. Supports regular expression.
   You should not use "default" as group names, otherwise the first replace would
   be parsed as default value to replace with, while the others would be ignored.
   Groups with no "pattern" would be ignored.
   Groups with no "replace" use default value.
   If multiple "pattern"s or "replace"s share the same group name, the last value set
   would be used.
```
- Chars/string not wrapped with syntaxes above would be considered single chars
  to be replaced with global replacement char/string, "_" if unset.
- When configuration file gets written to file, `customBadChars` would be
  replaced with parsed valid value. Single chars would be placed first, followed by
  `%replace<default>(your_default_replace_with)%`, and each group.
- Examples:
```
# If you just want to replace some single chars with "_"
\@[]
# If you want to replace them with "@":
\@[]%replace<default>(@)%
# If you want to replace certain words:
# This example would first replace all "maze" with "labyrinth",
# then all "labyrinth" with "nevermind"
%pattern<1>(maze)%%replace<1>(labyrinth)%%pattern<2>(labyrinth)%%replace<2>(nevermind)%
# If you want to replace characters within certain unicode range,
# then remove all continuous "_"s with a single "_":
%pattern<unicode>([\U0001d400-\U0001ffff])%%pattern<1>(_+)%%replace<1>(_)%
```
