A.Usage:
  Q1. How to paste japanese tags to the console window?
      - Click the top-left icon -> select Edit -> Paste (Cannot use Ctrl-V), if
        it show up as question mark -> Change the Language for non-Unicode
        program to Japanese (google it).
      - or use online url encoder (http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder/)
        and paste the encoded tag back to the console.
      - or paste it to tags.txt and select download by tags list. Separate each
        tags with space, and separate with new line for new query.
  Q2. My password doesn't show up in the console!
      - This is normal. The program still read it.
      - or you can put in the config.ini if not sure.
  Q3. I cannot login to pixiv!
      - Check your password.
      - Try to login to the Pixiv Website.
      - Try to use the config.ini on the [Authentication] section.
      - Check your date and time setting (e.g.: http://www.timeanddate.com/)
      - Disable Daylight Saving Time and try again.
      - Copy your session values from browser:
        1. Open Firefox.
        2. Go to Pixiv website and login, remember to enable [Remember Me]
           check box.
        3. Right click the page and select View Page Info.
        4. Click the Security tab.
        5. Click the View Cookies button.
        6. Look for Cookie named = PHPSESSID.
        7. Copy the content value.
        8. Open config.ini, go to [Authentication] section, paste the value
           to cookie, set keepsignedin = 1.
  Q4. PixivUtil working from local terminal on Linux box but not working when I
      used SSH with PuTTY!
      - export LANG=en_US.UTF-8. PuTTY does not set locales right, when they are
        not set, python does not know what to write (Thanks to nho!)
      - ... and export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8, so it can create DB and populate
        it properly (Thanks to Mailia!)
  Q5. How to delete member id from Database?
      - Open the application and choose Manage Database (d) then select delete
	Member by Member Id.
      - Open the database (db.sqlite) directly using sqlite browser and use sql
	command to delete it.
      - If you are downloading using Download from List.txt (3), you can create
	ignore_list.txt to skip the member id.
  Q6. The app doesn't download all the images!
      - Check your pixiv website settings (refer to https://goo.gl/gQi09v), 
        then delete the cookie value in config.ini and retry.
      - Check the value of r18mode in config.ini. Setting it to True will only 
        download R-18 images.        
  Q7. The apps show square/question mark texts in the console output!
      - This is because your windows is not to Japanese for the Regional Settings 
        in control panel.
      - Since 20161114+ version, you need to set the console font properties to
        use font with unicode support (e.g. Arial Unicode, MS Gothic). 

B.Bugs/Source Code/Supports:
  Q1. Where I can report for bugs?
      - Please report any bug to https://github.com/Nandaka/PixivUtil2/issues.
  Q2. Where I can support/donate to you?
      - You can send it to my PayPal account (nchek2000[at]gmail[dot]com).

  Q3. I want to use/modify the source code!
      - Feel free to use/modify the source code as long you give credit to me
        and make the modificated source code open.
      - if you want to add feature/bug fix, you can do fork the repository in
        https://github.com/Nandaka/PixivUtil2 and issue Pull Requests.
  Q4. I got ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '<something>'
      - Please modify _html.py from mechanize library, search for
        'def unescape_charref(data, encoding):' and replace with patch in
        http://pastebin.com/5bT5HFkb.
  Q5. I got '<library_name> module no found error'
      - Download the library from the source (see links from the Requirements
        section) and copy the file into your Lib\site-packages directory.
      - Or use pip install (google on how to use).

C.Log Messages:
Q1: HTTPError: HTTP Error 404: Not Found
    - This is because the file doesn't exists in the pixiv server, usually
       because there is no big images version for the manga mode (currently the
       apps will try to download the big version first then try the normal size
       if failed, this is only for the manga mode and it is normal).

Q2: Error at process_image(): (<type 'exceptions.WindowsError'>, WindowsError
    (32, 'Prosessi ei voi kayttaa tiedostoa, koska se on toisen prosessin
    kaytossa')
    - The file is being used by another process (google translate). Either you
      ran multiple instace of pixiv downloader from the same folder, or there
      are other processes locking the file/db.sqllite (usually from antivirus
      or some sync/backup application).

Q3: Error at process_image(): (<type 'exceptions.AttributeError'>,
    AttributeError ("'NoneType' object has no attribute 'find'",)
    - Usually this is because of login failed (cookie not valid). Try to change
      your password to simple one for testing, or copy the cookie from browser:
      1. Open Firefox/Chrome.
      2. Login to your pixiv.
      3. Right click the page and select View Page Info -> Security tab (Firefox), or
         Right click on the leftmost address bar/the (i) icon (Chrome)
      5. Click the View Cookies button.
      6. Look for Cookie named = PHPSESSID.
      7. Copy the content value.
      8. Open config.ini, go to [Authentication] section, paste the value to
         cookie.
    - Or because pixiv have changed the layout code, so the pixiv
      downloader cannot parse the page correctly. Please tell me by put a
      comment if this happen and include the details, such as the member/image
      id, dump html, and log file (check on the application folder).

Q4: URLError: <urlopen error [Errno 11004] getaddrinfo failed>
    - This is because the pixiv downloader cannot resolve the address to
      download the images, please try to restart the network connection or do
      ipconfig /flushdns to refresh the dns cache (windows).

Q5: Error at download_image(): (<class 'socket.timeout'>, timeout('timed out',)
    - This is because the pixiv downloaded didn't receive any reply for
      specified time in config.ini from pixiv. Please retry the download again
      later.

Q6: httperror_seek_wrapper: HTTP Error 403: request disallowed by robots.txt
    - Set userobots = False in config.ini

- This file should be build in the following way, white space will be trimmed,
  see example:

member_id1 directory1
member_id2 directory2
  ...
#comment - lines starting with # will be ignored

- member_id = in number only
- directory = path to download-directory for member_id
  - %root%\directory will save directory in rootFolder specified in config.ini
    \directory will save the folder in the root of your PixivUtil-drive
  - C:\directory will save the folder in drive C: (change to any other
    drive as you wish)
  - .\directory will save the folder in same directory as PixivUtil2.exe
  - directory-path can end with \ or not

- Examples for list:
### START EXAMPLE LIST####
# this is a comment line, lines starting with # will be ignored
# here is the first member:
123456
# you can see, the line has only the member id
# usually I use it the following way:
#
# username (so I can recognize it ;) )
123456
#
# next 2 lines contain a special folder for this member
123456 .\test
123456 ".\test"
# now all images from member no. 123456 will be safed in directory "test" in the
# same directory as PixivUtil2
# as you can see you can use it with "" or without ;)
#
# next will be stored at the same partition as PixivUtil, but the directory is
# located in root-part of it
123456 \test
123456 "\test"
# this will lead to "C:\test" when pixivUtil is located on "C:\"
#
# next line uses complete path to store the files
123456 F:\new Folder\test
123456 "F:\new Folder\test"
# this will set the folder everywhere on your partitions
#
123456 %root%\special folder
123456 "%root%\special folder"
# this will set the download location to "special folder" in your rootDirectory
# given in config
http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=123456
http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?id=123456
# also support url format.
